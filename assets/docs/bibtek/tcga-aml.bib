abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many mutations that contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are undefined. The relationships between patterns of mutations and epigenetic phenotypes are not yet clear.

METHODS: We analyzed the genomes of 200 clinically annotated adult cases of de novo AML, using either whole-genome sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150 cases), along with RNA and microRNA sequencing and DNA-methylation analysis.

RESULTS: AML genomes have fewer mutations than most other adult cancers, with an average of only 13 mutations found in genes. Of these, an average of 5 are in genes that are recurrently mutated in AML. A total of 23 genes were significantly mutated, and another 237 were mutated in two or more samples. Nearly all samples had at least 1 nonsynonymous mutation in one of nine categories of genes that are almost certainly relevant for pathogenesis, including transcription-factor fusions (18\% of cases), the gene encoding nucleophosmin (NPM1) (27\%), tumor-suppressor genes (16\%), DNA-methylation-related genes (44\%), signaling genes (59\%), chromatin-modifying genes (30\%), myeloid transcription-factor genes (22\%), cohesin-complex genes (13\%), and spliceosome-complex genes (14\%). Patterns of cooperation and mutual exclusivity suggested strong biologic relationships among several of the genes and categories.

CONCLUSIONS: We identified at least one potential driver mutation in nearly all AML samples and found that a complex interplay of genetic events contributes to AML pathogenesis in individual patients. The databases from this study are widely available to serve as a foundation for further investigations of AML pathogenesis, classification, and risk stratification.
