abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genetic variants that distinguish a control population from a population with a specific trait. Two challenges in GWAS are: (1) identification of the causal variant within a longer haplotype that is associated with the trait; (2) identification of causal variants for polygenic traits that are caused by variants in multiple genes within a pathway. We review recent methods that use information in protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction networks to address these two challenges.},
